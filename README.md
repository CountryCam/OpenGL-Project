# Cam's OpenGL project

This is an OpenGL Project we're doing for class.

## What's in this project?

← `README.md`: That's this file you're reading.

← `Main.cpp`: This is the main cpp file, where nearly all the magic happens.

← `Screen Class`: The Screen Class for my OpenGL Project, its what makes the window and the background colour.

← `Input Class`: This is the class that handles input!

## I plan to update this project in the future, to optimize it and add more features! Check out my links for news!
